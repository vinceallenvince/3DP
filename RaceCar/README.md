#Mini Racer

The [Mini Racer](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:721565) is fast, compact and fuel-effecient. An aerodynamic design
and minimalist take on suspension allow for maximum speed across hardwood
or linoleum flooring.

I made this toy for my son and his Fisher-Price Speed Tower. We wanted more
cars. Instead, of buying them separately, we designed and printed our own.
