#RPiA+ Audio project enclosure

3D print a simple enclosure for a Raspberry Pi audio project. I designed the enclosure around the Raspberry Pi A+ and the small Veho rechargeable speaker. It's meant to have a small physical footprint while protecting vital components.

Including the fasteners, spacers and hardware, there are 34 total parts. The 3D parts require ~2 hours printing time. The hardware and fasteners cost ~$60.00. See the full list below.
